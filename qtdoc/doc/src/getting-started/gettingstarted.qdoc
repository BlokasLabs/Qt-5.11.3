    \title Getting Started with Qt
    \brief A quick guide for developers

    \section1 Install Qt

    You can install the Qt Framework and tools by using an online or offline
    installer or by building the source packages yourself.

    In the \e{online installer}, you can select commercial or open source
    versions of Qt, tools, and Add-On components to install. Using the online
    installer requires signing in to your \l{Qt Account}. The installer
    retrieves the license attached to the account from a server and provides a
    list of available components corresponding to the license.

    An \e{offline installer} is a single package that contains all of Qt and
    Add-Ons relevant for a target platform. Users with a commercial license
    can either sign in with their Qt account or with their Qt license key
    during the installation process. The license key is available in the
    \l {Qt Account} Web portal.

    You can download Qt 5 installers from the \l Downloads page.

    You can use the Qt installers to download and install the following
    components:

    \list
    \li Qt libraries, prebuilt for a particular development platform (operating
     system and compiler)
    \li Qt Creator integrated development environment (IDE)
    \li Reference Documentation and examples
    \li Qt in source code form (needed only if you want to build the framework and
      tools yourself)
    \li Add-On components that are relevant for different platforms
    \endlist

    After downloading, start the installer like any executable on the
    development platform.

    To run the installer, you need a Qt Account. You can use your Qt Account
    credentials to sign-in to all Qt services, including the forums and wiki.
    If you do not already have a Qt Account, you can create one during the
    installation process.

    To complete the installation, select the components that you want to install
    and follow the instructions of the installation program.

    Use the Maintenance Tool under \e{<install_dir>} to add components and to
    update or remove installed components.

    \note From Qt 5.11, \l{QDoc Manual}{QDoc}, the Qt documentation generation
    tool, requires \l{http://clang.llvm.org}{clang} from LLVM 3.9 or greater for
    parsing C++ code. If you intend to use \l{QDoc Manual}{QDoc} to generate
    documentation for your own projects, or if you intend to build the Qt
    documentation locally from your Qt sources, see \l{Getting Started with QDoc}
    for details.

    \section2 Platform Requirements

    Developing applications on different platforms are covered in the platform
    pages.
    \list
    \li \l{Getting Started with Qt for Android}{Android}
    \li \l{Qt for iOS}{iOS}
    \li \l{Qt for Windows}{Windows}
    \li \l{Qt for Linux/X11}{Linux/X11}
    \li \l{Qt for macOS}{\macos}
    \li \l{Qt for WinRT}{Windows Runtime}
    \endlist

    For more information, visit the \l{Community Supported Platforms}
    {supported platforms} page.

    \section1 Create Your First Applications

    Learn the basics of Qt and Qt Quick development by following the two tutorials
    below that illustrate how to create simple applications and build and run them on
    target platforms:
    \list
    \li \l {Getting Started Programming with Qt Widgets}
    \li \l {Getting Started Programming with Qt Quick}
    \endlist

    \l{Qt Widgets} provides a library of UI elements which allow you to
    create classic desktop-style user interfaces. \l {Qt Quick} is a library
    providing types and functionalities for building modern, fluid, animated
    UIs.

    For a more thorough walkthrough of the different aspects of developing
    applications with Qt 5, see the \l {QML Book}. It focuses on Qt Quick,
    but also provides the information needed to use QML together with C++.

    \section1 Explore Qt

    We invite you to explore the rest of Qt. We prepared overviews which help
    you decide which APIs to use and our examples demonstrate how to use them.

    To view a list of all Qt examples, visit the \l{List of Qt Examples} page.
