 * This test should be run without any built-ins being added/augmented.
 * The name JSON must be bound to an object.
 * 
 * Section 15 says that every built-in Function object described in this
 * section � whether as a constructor, an ordinary function, or both � has
 * a length property whose value is an integer. Unless otherwise specified,
 * this value is equal to the largest number of named arguments shown in
 * the section headings for the function description, including optional
 * parameters.
 * 
 * This default applies to JSON.parse, and it must exist as a function
 * taking 2 parameters.
